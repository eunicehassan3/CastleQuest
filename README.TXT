## Welcome to CastleQuest! 
CastleQuest is a text-based video game which a student, bored out of his mind, decideds to explore the university --  only to wander into a world of it's own! 

## DETAILED STORYLINE: 
The player starts off in a classroom learning about the history of wall painting. About to die of boredom, he/she asks the teacher to go to the restroom, but then finds him/herself wandering around the school. Upon wandering, he/she sees an empty room with a glowing object . He/she is so fascinated by the glowing light that he/she doesn't see the sign above the door that says the "DO NOT ENTER". As he/she opens the door, he/realized that glowing object was just a glow in the dark pencil that someone probably left from the last class. Disappointed, he/she leaves but when he/she pushes the door, it doesn't open! So he/she opens what appears to be a closet but is actually the portal to a secret castle. In order for the player to win the game, He/She must look through a series of rooms to find the door that leads to his/her exit. The rooms include a dungeon, a kitchen, a ballroom, and a dragon's cave.
